## About myself

I want to work as a frontend developer because I like the process of creating websites and I like programming in general. Also this profession gives so much opportunities, such as remote work, moving to other city or country, career growth, high salary and so on.

I have a technical education. To achieve my goal I can spend a lot of time studying new information.

## Skills

- Web-development: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Version control: Git, GitHub
- Graphics: Figma

## Code example

```javascript
function deepCount(a){
  return a.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (Array.isArray(item) ? deepCount(item) : 0), a.length);
}
```
